# godot.project_blueprint
 my project blueprint for godot projects, I have yet to use and document it ;(

# The Brief
 This project is so I dont have to ever think about making menus, settings, or audio management ever again, for this, theres a few modules made, these can be divided upon:
 1. [MusicPlayer](https://github.com/kaneraZh/godot.project_blueprint?tab=readme-ov-file#musicplayer): Just a music player with added methods
 2. [Managers](https://github.com/kaneraZh/godot.project_blueprint?tab=readme-ov-file#managers): These are custom singletons meant to make interactions with singletons easier to manage, ie, managers, or helpers
 3. [UI Elements](https://github.com/kaneraZh/godot.project_blueprint?tab=readme-ov-file#ui-elements): These are for streamlining UX elements in the making of anything, they're easy to modify and manipulate in-editor, hopefully not much more is needed beyond what I've already done
 4. [The Custome Settings Script](https://github.com/kaneraZh/godot.project_blueprint?tab=readme-ov-file#the-custom_settings_setupgd-script): this is to setup a file that will setup custom settings every time the game is initialized
