# godot.project_blueprint
 my project blueprint for godot projects, I have yet to use and document it ;(

# The Brief
 This project is so I dont have to ever think about making menus, settings, or audio management ever again, for this, theres a few modules made, these can be divided upon:
 1. MusicPlayer: Just a music player with added methods
 2. Managers: These are custom singletons meant to make interactions with singletons easier to manage, ie, managers, or helpers
 3. UI Elements: These are for streamlining UX elements in the making of anything, they're easy to modify and manipulate in-editor, hopefully not much more is needed beyond what I've already done
 4. The Custome Settings Script: this is to setup a file that will setup custom settings every time the game is initialized
